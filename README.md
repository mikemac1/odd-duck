## Comments & Reflections Lab 11

* How did this go, overall?
Very frustrating from several standpoints. I spent almost 8 hours on this lab and I believe the site works per the requirements however it did not start that way. First I focused completely on the wireframe without fully reading the directions so I didn't include a view results button. I was able to generate results and update real time as selections were made. Then after reading the directions realized a view results button was required. It goes to show that reading the direction first is key in any task assigned. Then I created the button but the results show only some of the time after the conditions are met. It is like the button only works in very specific places.  I placed console.log messages in the function so I see it happening just don't know why it works some time but not all the time.

* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
I know I need to pay attention and read before I start immediately working on something when assigned.  But too be brutally honest, I do not know what I am doing. I used Sheyna's demo as my starting point and had to refer to it constantly. I feel like a fraud.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
I will be honest that I am not surprised that after almost 8 hours I am typing this out right now. When I went into the lab I didn't feel good and I feel even worse now. I assumed it was not going to go well.
