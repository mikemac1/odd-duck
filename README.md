## Lab 11/12/13

## Problem Domain

17 October - Building a site for the Odd Duck Product Co and allow employees to vote for 1 of the 3 products displayed that they think should be the next new product brought to market.
18 October - The site will now ensure no one of the same 3 products will be seen on the subsequent vote. Also once the vote is completed it will automatically generate a bar chart.
19 October - Goal is to implement localStorage such that table & chart values will return after a refresh of the page and the 25 maxVisits has been reset.

## Comments & Reflections Lab 11

* How did this go, overall?
Very frustrating from several standpoints. I spent almost 8 hours on this lab and I believe the site works per the requirements however it did not start that way. First I focused completely on the wireframe without fully reading the directions so I didn't include a view results button. I was able to generate results and update real time as selections were made. Then after reading the directions realized a view results button was required. It goes to show that reading the direction first is key in any task assigned. Then I created the button but the results show only some of the time after the conditions are met. It is like the button only works in very specific places.  I placed console.log messages in the function so I see it happening just don't know why it works some time but not all the time.

* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
I know I need to pay attention and read before I start immediately working on something when assigned.  But too be brutally honest, I do not know what I am doing. I used Sheyna's demo as my starting point and had to refer to it constantly. I feel like a fraud.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
I will be honest that I am not surprised that after almost 8 hours I am typing this out right now. When I went into the lab I didn't feel good and I feel even worse now. I assumed it was not going to go well.

* How did this go, overall?
Overall I did okay with the lab as I did much better with the chartJS portion as I really love data visualization. Tried out different variations with the attributes available to set for the chart and integrated into the grid quite easily. The JS portion of the lab is completed but it is still a work in progress. I kind of have an inkling on how to set it up but there are portions I have no idea on how it works the way it does.

* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
Definitely looking forward to getting my hands on more charts to play with.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
Was able to finish in four hours and kind of suprised it only took that amount of time as I expected integrating the chart to take longer.
